title: "CoderDojo Wien Hackathon at WeAreDevelopers"
description: "Yes, you've made it to WeAreDevelopers! Now it's your time to prove you are able to take the toughest challenge a developer can face. Show that you're not only an expert but a master who can teach!

<h2>What the hack</h2>
We free to let your creativity flow. Just keep in mind that your exercise should be solvable by a kid at the age from 7 to 17. Take a brief look <a href='/exercises' target='_blank'>here</a> and see who an exercise can look like. We'll have a bunch of <a href='https://www.microbit.org/guide/' target='_blank'>micro:bits</a> with us, if you would like to develop with them. Other platforms we've got exercises already are Scratch, C# and JavaScript but feel free to choose something different as long as it's available for free.

<h2>Sumission Guidelines</h2>
Submit your examples as pull-request to our exercises repository at <a href='https://github.com/coderdojo-wien/exercises'> target='_blank'>https://github.com/coderdojo-wien/exercises</>.

An exercise should be self-contained, ie contain a description of the task and an exemplary solution (both as README in GitHub Markdown format, language English or German). Full source has to be attached, too. See our <a href='https://github.com/coderdojo-wien/exercises/tree/dev/nodejs/Selfie_Bot'>Selfie-Bot</a> as reference.

The exercice can be developed using the platform of your choice, aslong as the tools and runtime are available for free.

By submitting a pull-request to acknowledge that your submitted code is subject to the <a href='https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt'>GNU GPL v3</a>.

<h2>Finish</h2>
On Wednesday and Thurstday our jury will choose two extraordinary submissions which will be rewarded with a brand new BBC micro:bit, which were generously sponsed by The Micro:bit Foundation."
